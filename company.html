    <h4 class="insight">Insight</h4>
    <div class="insight"><p>Apple Inc. operates as a publicly traded corporation on the 
        Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol AAPL, 
        with shares widely dispersed among institutional and retail 
        investors. Institutional ownership accounts for approximately 
        64.34% of outstanding shares, reflecting significant influence 
        from large asset managers but no single controlling entity. 
        The Vanguard Group holds the largest stake at about 9.54%, 
        followed by BlackRock at 5.87% and State Street Corporation at 
        around 4%. Insider ownership, including shares held by executives
         and directors such as Tim Cook and Arthur Levinson, is minimal 
         at roughly 0.06%, emphasizing the company's reliance on public 
         markets for capital and accountability. Berkshire Hathaway also 
         maintains a substantial position, valued at tens of billions, 
        though exact percentages fluctuate with market activity.</p></div>
